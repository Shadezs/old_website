<h3>Some backstory about myself: </h3>
     <li> I'm currently a computer science major at Santa Monica College. I immigrated from Guatemala with my family when
         I was eleven years old. I never really had an opportunity to learn about electronics and programming when I was in Guatemala, it was until I came to the united states
         that I got the opportunity to learn about computers. I got my first computer when I was in 8th grade and it wasn't until I reach 9th grade when I got exposed to programming. Ever since the day
         I have always love programming. It is taking me longer then I want to finish school due to a medical condition but thanks to my current job I get to teach programming and it helps me improve my c++ and c skills and learn new ones.</li>
